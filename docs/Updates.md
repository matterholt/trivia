# Reviewing code  

## Updates Made
1. Status for handling errors. Added an if error statement if fetch returns an error.
2. On the Home page the "idle" is standard return. 
3. added Mock server, for debugging and testing 
4. remove key prop from result card



## Noted Concerns
1. console warning: Cannot update a component (`App`) while rendering a different component (`Home`). To locate the bad setState() call inside `Home`. Router update and redirect.
